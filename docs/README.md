## What is formseal-fetch?

formseal-fetch is a CLI tool that downloads encrypted form submissions from your storage backend (currently we only support Cloudflare KV). Use it together with [formseal-embed](https://github.com/grayguava/formseal-embed) — the client-side form encryption library.

## Workflow

```
Browser (formseal-embed)
       │
       ▼ (encrypted submissions)
  Cloudflare KV
       │
       ▼ (fsf fetch)
  ciphertexts.jsonl ──► Your PC
```
